Net Defence Game
================

Net Defence was first created as a result of the GUTS (Glasgow University Tech Society) hackathon by team GeekSoc.

Net Defence was originally a location based capture game. https://github.com/GeekSoc/NetDefence

I will try to make a game based on the idea of the original game.
